# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Bio:
Hi, I'm Egor. Student of Novosibirsk Technical College from West Siberia, Russia. I passioned by a lot of things. Writing a book, writing music and, among other things, developing all sorts of things. I havenâ€™t (still (for 5 years)) found what Iâ€™m good at and what I like most. For now I'm working on my [kernel](https://github.com/sovencho/kernel-four "Kernel4") and also doing robotics based on ROS.

## Knowledge:
My first and still used programming language is Python. I use it in most of my projects, as well as when working with ROS. I also learning and programming in C and Kotlin. For software, I use different OSs (Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu (WSL), Windows), different editors (VSCode, neovim, sometimes nano). So far I donâ€™t have any projects that I could show, but in the future they will appear here.
